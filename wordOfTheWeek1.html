			<h3>So word of the week is a new thing that I have decided to do on my blog. So, predictably, I have chosen Predictble, I have 
	chosen predictable because it was recommended by me. So, the exact definnition of predictable? Well according to dictionary.com
	it is: "able to be foretold or declared in advance". What does this mean? Well Predict<b>able</b> is the past tense of predict
	 so it basically means if someone whose discord name happens to be beethoven27 says the 590 is better than the 5700xt, we will 
	 all say predictable. So, the history of this word. Legend has it, that one day in early November 2019, someone started overusing the word 
	 at school, and the rest is history.</h3>
