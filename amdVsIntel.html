				<b>Why AMD is Better that Intel (Opinion)</b>

				<h3>OK, so i'll admit, the Intel core I9 9900k performs better than the ryzen 9 3900x in real world standard. Now The Ryzen
						9 has better specifications and works better with running all cores according to Pop Mech Pro. But, running on a single 
						core, which most games run right now the I9 runs better. Now you see I think the Ryzen 9 is better still because it
						is a better price for just a littlebit less performance.Now, if your running something on all cores the specifications
						are significantly better than the I9s and it runsmuch cooler. And considering that you can get the <i>Radeon RX5700xt</i> with the Ryzen 9 and it will communicate 
						at PCIe 4.0 speed this is a much better deal! Overall, considering all of the facts I conclude that AMD Ryzen is 
						better than Intel. (I will write more threads on this, no pun intended)</h3>
