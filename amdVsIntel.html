<h1><b>Why AMD is Better that Intel</b></h1>
<h3>By:Drew Novak
<p>OK, so i'll admit, the Intel core I9 9900k performs better than the ryzen 9 3900x in real world standard. Now The Ryzen 9 has better 
specifications and works better with running all cores according to Pop Mech Pro. But, running one core, which most games run right now 
the I9 runs better. Now you see I think the Ryzen 9 is better still because it is a better price for just a little bit less performance.
. Now, if your runnong something on all cores the specifications are significantly better than the I9s and it runs much cooler. And considering that you can get the <i>Radeon RX5700xt</i> with the Ryzen 9 and it will communicate 
at PCIe 4.0 speed this is a much better deal! Overall, considering all of the facts I conclude that AMD is better than Intel. (I will write more threads on this, no pun intended)</p>
